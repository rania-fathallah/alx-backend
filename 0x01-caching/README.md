# 0x01 Caching

This project is part of the ALX Backend curriculum. It covers the fundamentals of caching in backend systems, a technique used to optimize performance by storing copies of frequently accessed data. Efficient caching reduces database load, improves response times, and enhances the scalability of applications.

## About

Caching is a technique that stores copies of frequently accessed data in memory to reduce retrieval times and system load. This project covers several caching strategies, including basic in-memory caching, Least Recently Used (LRU) caching, and Least Frequently Used (LFU) caching. You will learn to implement these strategies in a Python backend application, making it faster and more efficient.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand the concept and purpose of caching in backend applications.
- Implement basic caching strategies using data structures.
- Use LRU and LFU caching mechanisms.
- Configure cache expiration policies.
- Test cache efficiency and measure improvements in response time.
