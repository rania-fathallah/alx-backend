# 0x00 Pagination

This project is part of the ALX Backend curriculum. It focuses on implementing pagination to efficiently manage and display large datasets by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts. Pagination is an essential feature in backend applications to enhance performance, reduce load times, and improve user experience.

## About

Pagination is a backend technique used to split large sets of data into smaller parts or "pages," allowing applications to efficiently fetch, display, and manage data. This project involves creating pagination mechanisms for APIs, ensuring the backend can deliver data in a paginated format that can be easily consumed by clients.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand the concept and purpose of pagination in backend applications.
- Implement pagination using offset-based and cursor-based methods.
- Build API endpoints that support paginated data retrieval.
- Configure pagination controls (e.g., page size, next/previous links).
- Handle edge cases such as empty pages and invalid page requests.
